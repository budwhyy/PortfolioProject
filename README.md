# PortfolioProject

Hi All. 
 
This is a Portfolio Project i created with the help and insight provided by Alex Freberg AKA "Alex the analyst".
The data source is "https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths" which has the latest Coid-19 pandemic data.

Steps involved in the analysis

1) Cleaning data : The dataset was sorted and cleaned using MSEXCEL where two tables were created - Covid Deaths and Covid Vaccinations. 
2) Processed and analysis : The tables were then imported into SQL for analysis. The repository contains codes that was used in the analysis 
3) Data Viz : Data generated by analysis was then exported to Tableau for data viz. The dashboard created is available on the following link : 

"https://public.tableau.com/views/Covid19-June2022Updates/Dashboard1?:language=en-GB&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link"


There will be more updates in the future and i will be working on them in time. 

Thank you.
